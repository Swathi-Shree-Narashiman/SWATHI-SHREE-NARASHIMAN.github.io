# Research Projects

## 1. Summer @ EPFL Research Internship
- **Location:** Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland  
- **Duration:** May 2024 – August 2024  
- **Details:**
  - Developed an end-to-end lensless imaging technique for autonomous vehicles.  
  - Worked on deep learning-based 3D point cloud reconstruction.  
  - Enhanced reconstruction quality using PCN (Point Completion Networks) and KL Divergence techniques.  

## 2. Undergraduate Research (IIT Madras)
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Nitin Chandrachoodan  
- **Duration:** August 2023 – August 2024  
- **Details:**
  - Developed AlphaZip, a lossless text compression method achieving 4.5x compression in Gutenberg corpora.  
  - Utilized rank-based predictive compression and tested various architectures (LSTMs, Transformers, etc.).  

## 3. Undergraduate Research (UC San Diego - Remote)
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Nambi Sheshadri  
- **Duration:** August 2024 – Present  
- **Details:**
  - Exploring model merging techniques like SLERP and PCA for creating supermodels.  
  - Working on fine-tuning methods to reduce hallucinations in generative models.
